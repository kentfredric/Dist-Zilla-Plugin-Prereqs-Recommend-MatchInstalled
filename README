Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs::Recommend::MatchInstalled

The "[Prereqs::Recommend::MatchInstalled]" is a tool for authors who
wish to keep end users informed of which versions of critical
dependencies the author has themselves used, as an encouragement for the
users to consume at least that version, but without making it a hard
requirement.

In practice this can be used for anything, but this modules author
currently recommends you restrict this approach only to development
dependencies, *mostly* because even a system of auto-recommendation is
still too aggressive for most modules, or if you insist this concept on
"CPAN", use something with "but not larger than" mechanics like
"[Prereqs::Upgrade]"
